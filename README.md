# Dynamic Form Implementation in React ✨

## Description 📋
This project demonstrates a dynamic form built using React, where the form fields are generated based on API-like configurations. The form can be adjusted dynamically based on user selections (e.g., choosing different options from a dropdown), and it supports adding, editing, and deleting form entries. It also includes a progress bar, form validation, and displays submitted data in a tabular format.

## Features ⚡

- ➕ Ability to add, ✏️ edit, and ❌ delete form data.
- ✅ Form validation based on backend configuration (required fields and data types).
- 📱 Responsive UI that adjusts for both desktop and mobile devices.
- 💬 User feedback and success/error messages for interactions.
- ⏳ Progress bar that updates as the user fills out the form.
- 📊 Display of submitted data in a table format, with options to edit and delete entries.
